instructions_description_label=<p align\="justify">Standard complications are managed by WatchOS and only refresh at 15-90 minutes intervals. The only exception is the calendar complication, which refreshes instantly. For that reason, Spike uses the calendar complication to display your glucose values on your Apple Watch without any delay.</p><p></p><p align\="justify">To use this feature, please perform the following steps\:</p><p></p><ul><li><p align\="justify"><b>Create a dedicated calendar\:</b> Open the Calendar app on your device by clicking the Calendar icon directly from your home screen. Click the "Calendars" button at the bottom, then click "Edit" and under iCloud click "Add calendar". Give the calendar a name (for instance "Spike") and click "Done". If you don't have an iCloud account configured in your iOS device you should create one or choose a calendar that's not hosted on iCloud (not recommended). You don't need to create a new calendar for Spike but it's highly recommended to keep things tidy. You can use calendars that are not hosted in iCloud, like Gmail or other online services, but using an iCloud calendar will allow you to send data to your Apple Watch faster and completely offline.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>Sync calendar to the watch\:</b> Open the Watch app on your device by clicking the Watch icon directly from your home screen. Go to "Calendar" and under the "Calendars" section click "Custom" and make sure the calendar you created in the previous step is selected. Try to have as less calendars as possible synced to your Apple Watch otherwise your glucose values might get overlapped by other calendar's events.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>Authorize Spike\:</b> Activate the "Enabled" toggle at the top of this screen, click the "Authorize" button and allow Spike to access your calendars. If by any chance you deny access to your calendars and want to enable it at a later time you'll need to go to your device settings, privacy, calendars and turn on "Spike".</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>Configure complication in Spike\:</b> Select the newly created calendar from step 1 and choose the information that you want to have displayed in your Apple Watch.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>Configure complication in Apple Watch\:</b> On your Apple Watch or the Watch app in your iOS device select the "Modular" watch face and make sure you also select the "Calendar Complication" to be present in the middle of the watch face (Spike is also compatible with Siri, Utilities, Activity (digital and analog), Mickey Mouse, Toy Story, Timelapse, Motion and Kaleidoscope watch faces). Your glucose values should now start syncing to your watch when you receive your next reading from your CGM transmitter. If by any change you're not getting readings in your Apple Watch, go to the Watch app and under "General", "Reset" click the "Reset Sync Data" and wait a few minutes. You might need to do this every time you reboot your device or Apple Watch, sometimes iOS can be a bit temperamental when syncing data from your device to your Apple Watch after a reboot.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>My Apple Watch stops displaying my values (gaps) between readings after a few minutes. Is there anything I can do?</b> Yes. Try to enable the "Gap Fix" option. When enabled, Spike will always create a 10 minute calendar event with your latest glucose value. This seems to fix the issue. As soon as a new reading comes from your transmitter, Spike will edit the previous calendar event and set it to 5 minutes before adding the new 10 minute calendar event. This will avoid event overlaps.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>How can I access my glucose history on the Apple Watch?</b> Simply tap the calendar complication on your Apple Watch and your glucose history will be presented in a popup.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>Can I have my data displayed in a chart on my Apple Watch?</b> Yes\! Head over to settings -> integration, enable internal HTTP server and follow the on-screen instructions on how to setup Nightguard with Spike.</p></li><li><p align\="justify"><b>Can I share my glucose values to another person's Apple Watch?</b> Yes\! As long as you share with that person the calendar you created in step 1 they can have your glucose values displayed on their Apple Watch as well. They will need to follow steps 2 & 5 on their iOS device. They will also need to have an active Internet connection at all times and should go to Settings, Calendar, Accounts, Fetch New Data and under iCloud select Push so that new glucose values are downloaded automatically from iCloud and synced to the watch. For instructions on how to share with other people the calendar you created in step 1 please follow <a href\="https\://support.apple.com/kb/ph2690">this <font color\="\#0086FF">link</font></a>.</p></li></ul>
