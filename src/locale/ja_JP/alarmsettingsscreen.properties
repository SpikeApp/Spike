workflow_alarms_email_body=<p>Hello Spiker\!</p><h2>Today Widget / Apple Watch</h2><p>Make sure you have the Workflow app installed on your device. You can get it <a href\="https\://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334">here</a>, it's free. Go to your Today View and add the Workflow Today Widget. If you have an Apple Watch and want to be able to request readings on-demand directly from the watch you will need to install Workflow on it. You can do this directly from the Watch app on your device.</p><p>To configure both the Today Widget and Apple Watch click on the following links. You're free to change the color and title but be sure not to change the workflow configuration. When you click the workflow and select "GET WORKFLOW" it will be automatically added to your Today Widget and Apple Watch.</p><ul><li><a href\="https\://workflow.is/workflows/79edd275b8044f8f957c08883d7cf052">Alarms Snoozer</a></li><li><a href\="https\://workflow.is/workflows/7ad6275c117a408ea6fd7cfdddf32162">Alarms Un-Snoozer</a></li></ul><p></p><h2>Note</h2><p>Don't forget to enable the internal HTTP server in Spike's Settings -> Intergration.
