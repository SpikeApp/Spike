missed_readings_description=<p align\="justify">If you're experiencing missed readings or gaps in Spike, especially during the night, try the following suggestions\:</p><p></p><li><p align\="justify">Close or uninstall any app that might be trying to connect to your transmitter, this includes Today Widgets and Apple Watch complications.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">If you are using Loop to get readings from Spike, remove the transmitter ID from inside Loop.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">Close all unneeded apps from the app switcher at all times to free some memory.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">Unpair all unneeded Bluetooth devices in iOS settings, Bluetooth.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">Disable Background app refresh from all unneeded apps and keep it on for Spike. You can do this in iOS settings, General, Background App Refresh.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">Be sure to disable sending analytics to Apple. This can cause additional strain to your iOS, especially during the night, and make iOS throw apps out of memory. You can disable it in iOS Settings, Privacy, Analytics (or Diagnostic & Usage if you're on iOS 10).</p></li><li><p align\="justify">In Spike's settings go to advanced and turn on very aggressive. If that doesn't work try to also enable alternative methods.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">At night, disconnect WiFi and just keep Bluetooth on. Even better, put the phone in Airplane mode and activate Bluetooth.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">Go to iOS Settings, General, Reset and Reset Network Settings. After your device reboots, open Spike and wait for a new Bluetooth pairing request.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">If you're on iOS 11, be sure to update to version 11.3 or above.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">If you're using a BluCon transmitter, please reset it (they tend to not reconnect to the device after going out of range). To reset the BluCon transmitter and make it pair get a pin and push into the tiny hole on the top of the transmitter. A light blinks red indicating it was pushed. After that, return to Spike and keep it in the foreground for up to 15 minutes without locking your device.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">Make sure your transmitter battery is ok. You can check it in main menu -> transmitter.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">If none of the above works for you, leaving Spike open in the foreground at night with the screen dimmed and without locking your device, tends to be sufficient for iOS not to kill Spike from memory. If you go this route, be sure to leave your device charging. You can also try to reinstall iOS from scratch (without doing it from an iCloud backup) as this tends to fix most issues caused by another app or service that might be consuming too many resources on your device.</p></li><li><p align\="justify">As a rule of thumb, always reboot your device first thing in the morning and before going to bed to keep it's memory clean and used resources to a minimum.</p></li>
